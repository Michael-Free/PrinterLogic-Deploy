# PrinterLogic-Deploy


## Ubuntu/
This directory contains bash script for installing PrinterLogic agent software on an Ubuntu system called `install-pl.sh`.  For more information please refer to the `README.md` file in that directory.

## Windows/
This directory contains a batch script for installing PrinterLogic agent software on a Windows system called `install-pl.cmd`.  For more information please refer to the `README.md` file in that directory.

## About
Both scripts share similar functionality, such as setting variables, checking for admin privileges, and installing the application using the appropriate installer file. However, they use different commands and syntax specific to their respective operating systems. 

This repository should make it easier for developers or system administrators to deploy the PrinterLogic agent on both Windows and Ubuntu systems.
